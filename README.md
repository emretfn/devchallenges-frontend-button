## Overview

### You can see the demo [here](https://devchallenges-frontend-button.vercel.app/)

### Experience Gained
With this challenge, I have consolidated the technologies I know in general. I created a ui component that can take multiple props. I did this challenge to put in my portfolio using technologies such as Typescript, Css modules , SASS and React. I also used BEM Modifier for CSS class naming. In general I didn't get stuck, but for example I got stuck with variant="text" and the way it looks different if it takes disabled props. I researched this and solved it using SCSS and BEM modifier. Apart from this, I provided the story that is "I can still access all button attributes" in the challenge, but I wanted the component to be autocompelete and typesafe where it was called, so I did a research and solved this problem with TypeScript.
### Improved things
In general, I improved my ability to write css using SCSS. I used to consider myself weak as CSS, but now I feel more comfortable with CSS. I also better understand how to create a typesafe component using Typescript with React.
